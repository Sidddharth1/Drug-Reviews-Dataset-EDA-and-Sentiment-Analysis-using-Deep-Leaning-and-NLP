# Drug-Reviews-Dataset-EDA-and-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Deep-Leaning-and-NLP

Drugs Reviews Dataset:

We will be using this open source dataset made available by UCI machine learning library to perform EDA and sentiment analysis. We will use NLP and Deep Learning to make a sentiment prediction model using the text review data.

This is an intermediate model and by no means a complete model, we can go through another phase of hyperparameter tuning to tweak our the performance of our model further.
